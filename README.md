# remote-components-runtime
PoC to see if it's possible to pull in JS components from a remote location at runtime within a React project

Warning: the packages used in this project are pretty old, and I frequently get Dependabot reminders to update them, but as I'm not using the project for anything serious, this isn't a high priority so I'm going to leave it here for reference but archived, but please do not use it as-is and use common sense regarding package versions etc. in all your projects, not just if you interact with this.
